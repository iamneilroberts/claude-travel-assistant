# Flight Planning Guide

Strategic guidance for finding and presenting flight options that sell proposals while protecting agent margins.

## Core Principle

**Proposals sell the trip first; bookings happen later.**

Quote flights slightly above likely booking price to allow for:
- Price fluctuations between proposal and booking
- Agent margin protection
- Upgrade opportunities during booking
- Change fee buffers

## Gathering Flight Information

### Required from Client
1. **Home airport** - Primary departure point
2. **Alternate airports** - Within reasonable driving distance (1-2 hours)
3. **Travel dates** - Fixed or flexible?
4. **Return flexibility** - Must return by specific date/time?

### Infer from Context (Don't Always Ask Directly)

**Layover Tolerance** - Read between the lines:

| Signal | Inference |
|--------|-----------|
| Elderly travelers (70+) | Prefer nonstop or short connections (<2 hrs) |
| Young children | Minimize connections, avoid red-eyes |
| First international trip | Simple routing, generous connection times (2+ hrs) |
| Budget-conscious language | May accept longer layovers for savings |
| "We're flexible" | Open to creative routing |
| Business travelers | Time-efficient, willing to pay for nonstop |
| Adventure travelers | More tolerant of complex routing |
| Medical/mobility mentions | Nonstop strongly preferred |
| Tight schedule ("only have 5 days") | Nonstop to maximize destination time |

**Budget Tolerance** - Infer from:
- Hotel tier preferences mentioned
- Activity choices (group tours vs private)
- "Splurge" vs "save where we can" language
- Occasion (honeymoon = more flexible, annual trip = budget-aware)

## Routing Strategy

### Always Research
1. **Primary airport** - Direct flights, major carriers
2. **Nearby alternates** - If savings exceed $200/person, mention them
3. **Hub connections** - Sometimes cheaper than nonstop

### Alternate Airport Decision

Present alternates when:
- Savings > $200/person AND
- Drive time < 90 minutes AND
- Doesn't add complexity to an already complex trip

Skip alternates when:
- Client mentioned convenience priority
- Elderly or young children traveling
- Trip is already logistically complex
- Savings are marginal (<$100/person)

### Connection Quality

**Good connections:**
- 1.5-3 hours domestic
- 2-4 hours international
- Same terminal or easy transfer
- Through reliable hubs (not weather-prone in winter)

**Avoid:**
- Under 1 hour domestic, under 1.5 hours international
- Different airport connections (LGA→JFK)
- Last flight of the day on tight connections
- Weather-risky hubs in winter (ORD, DEN, EWR December-February)

## Pricing Strategy by Tier

### Value Tier: "Essential"

**Target:** Just above cheapest bookable fare

- **Cabin:** Main cabin (NOT basic economy)
- **Why not basic economy:** No changes, no seat selection, bad client experience
- **Buffer:** Quote 10-15% above current pricing
- **Positioning:** "Affordable and flexible"

```
✓ Main cabin with standard baggage
✓ Seat selection included
✓ Change fees apply but possible
✗ Not basic economy (no changes allowed)
```

### Premium Tier: "Enhanced"

**Target:** Comfort upgrade on long legs

- **Cabin logic:**
  - Legs under 3 hours: Main cabin (upgrade not worth it)
  - Legs 3-6 hours: Premium economy
  - Legs 6+ hours: Premium economy strongly recommended

- **Buffer:** Quote 10-15% above current pricing
- **Positioning:** "Extra comfort where it matters"

```
✓ Premium economy on long-haul segments
✓ Extra legroom, better recline
✓ Priority boarding, better meals
✓ Main cabin fine for short hops
```

### Luxury Tier: "Ultimate"

**Target:** Business class IF reasonably priced

**The Business Class Decision:**

This is critical. Business class can 3-10x the flight cost. Don't let outrageous flight pricing kill a high-commission luxury trip.

**Decision framework:**

| Business Class Price | Flight as % of Trip | Recommendation |
|---------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| < 2x premium economy | Any | Include business |
| 2-3x premium economy | < 30% of trip total | Include business |
| 2-3x premium economy | > 30% of trip total | Offer as option |
| > 3x premium economy | Any | Default to premium economy |

**Example calculations:**

*Trip total target: $15,000 for couple*
- Economy: $1,200/person = $2,400 (16% of trip) ✓
- Business: $6,000/person = $12,000 (80% of trip) ✗ Too high

*Better approach for this trip:*
- Premium economy: $2,000/person = $4,000 (27% of trip) ✓
- Note: "Business class available at $12,000 if desired"

**When to always include business:**
- Ultra-luxury trips ($30k+ per person)
- Client specifically requested it
- Flight is 10+ hours
- Overnight flight where sleep matters

**Positioning:**
```
✓ Business class on [long-haul segment]
  OR
✓ Premium economy with business class available upon request
✓ Lounge access
✓ Priority everything
```

## Presenting Flight Options

### Format

```
**Flights: [Origin] → [Destination]**

OUTBOUND - [Date]
  [Airline] [Flight#]: [Depart City] [Time] → [Arrive City] [Time]
  [If connection: Connection info]
  Duration: X hrs | [Nonstop/1 stop]

RETURN - [Date]
  [Airline] [Flight#]: [Depart City] [Time] → [Arrive City] [Time]
  Duration: X hrs | [Nonstop/1 stop]

Estimated cost: $X,XXX/person ([cabin class])
```

### What to Include

**Always mention:**
- Total travel time (not just flight time)
- Number of stops
- Airline(s)
- Cabin class for tier
- Per-person pricing

**For connections, add:**
- Connection airport and duration
- Terminal change if relevant
- "Generous connection time" or flag if tight

### Alternate Options

When presenting alternates:

```
**Option A (Recommended):** Nonstop from [Home Airport]
  $X,XXX/person | 8 hrs total

**Option B (Budget):** 1-stop from [Alternate Airport]
  $X,XXX/person | 11 hrs total | Saves $400/person
  Note: Requires 90-min drive to airport
```

## Margin Protection

### The Proposal Buffer

Flights fluctuate. Protect your margin:

| Time to Travel | Buffer to Add |
|----------------|---------------|
| 6+ months out | +10-15% |
| 3-6 months out | +10% |
| 1-3 months out | +5-10% |
| Under 1 month | Quote actual (less fluctuation) |

### Language for Proposals

Use protective language:
- "Estimated at $X,XXX" (not "costs $X,XXX")
- "Current pricing around..."
- "Budget approximately..."
- "Subject to availability at time of booking"

### Never Promise Specific Flights

Proposals show routing and estimates. Actual flights booked may differ:
- Times may shift
- Airlines may change
- Prices will vary

Frame as: "We'll secure the best available flights matching this routing when you're ready to book."

## Red Flags to Watch

**Pricing red flags:**
- Basic economy appearing as "great deal" (it's not - no changes)
- Business class > 4x economy (sticker shock risk)
- Fuel surcharges not included in displayed price

**Routing red flags:**
- Connections under 1 hour
- Arriving late night with early morning activity next day
- Weather-risk connections in winter
- Different airline connections (baggage re-check hassle)

**Client red flags:**
- "Whatever's cheapest" → They'll blame you when basic economy is miserable
- Over-optimizing → Complex routing fails; keep it simple

## Quick Reference

| Tier | Cabin | Buffer | Key Message |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Value | Main cabin | +10-15% | Affordable with flexibility |
| Premium | Premium econ (3+ hr legs) | +10-15% | Comfort where it counts |
| Luxury | Business (if reasonable) | +10% | The full experience |

**Layover inference:** Old/young/first-timers → simple routing. Experienced/flexible → can handle connections.

**Alternate airports:** Only if savings > $200/person AND < 90 min drive.

**Business class ceiling:** If > 3x premium economy, default to premium and offer business as option.
