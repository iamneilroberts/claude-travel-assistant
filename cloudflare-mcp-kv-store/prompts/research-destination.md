# Destination Research

When a client is undecided or exploring options, research destinations systematically before starting trip planning.

## When to Use This

- Client says "I want to go somewhere warm" (no specific destination)
- Client is choosing between multiple destinations
- Client asks "Where should we go for our anniversary?"
- Client has dates but not destination

## Gather Preferences First

Before researching, ask about:

1. **Climate** - Tropical, temperate, dry, doesn't matter?
2. **Activities** - Beach, culture, adventure, relaxation, food, nightlife?
3. **Budget** - Ballpark per person or total
4. **Experience Level** - First international trip vs seasoned traveler
5. **Travel Style** - All-inclusive, independent exploration, guided tours?
6. **Physical Needs** - Mobility concerns, altitude sensitivity, dietary restrictions
7. **Time Available** - Weekend, week, two weeks?
8. **From Where** - Home airport (affects flight options)

## Research Structure
