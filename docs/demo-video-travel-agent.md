# Travel Agent Demo Video Production Guide

**Duration:** 3-5 minutes
**Style:** Captions + music only (no voiceover)
**Tool setup:** See `demo-video-tools.md`

---

## Target Audience

Non-technical travel agents who:
- Are frustrated with clunky agency software
- Copy-paste between spreadsheets and PDFs
- Want to look more professional to clients
- Already use or are curious about AI assistants

**Emotional appeal:** "Finally, something that works the way I think."

---

## Key Messages (Caption Themes)

These are the takeaways viewers should remember:

1. **"No software to learn"** - It's a conversation, not an interface
2. **"Just talk. It builds the trip."** - Natural language, no forms
3. **"Your brand. Your clients."** - White-label, professional output
4. **"Professional proposals in minutes"** - Speed + quality

---

## Demo Account Setup (Before Recording)

### Create or Use Demo User

Use a demo account with polished branding:

- **User:** Demo account with nice branding (logo, colors, contact info)
- **Subdomain:** Should look professional (e.g., `kim.voygent.ai` or `demo.voygent.ai`)

### Load Sample Content

Ensure sample trips are available:
- `europe-romantic-7day` - Good for romantic/couples demo
- `caribbean-cruise-family` - Good for cruise/family demo

Or create a fresh trip during recording (more authentic but riskier).

### Branding Configuration

Make sure the demo account has:
- Uploaded logo (appears in header)
- Brand colors configured
- Contact information filled in
- Professional-looking settings

## Editing Notes

### Speed Adjustments
- **1.0x (normal):** Conversation moments, preview reveal, proposal scroll
- **1.5x:** Trip building montage, repetitive typing
- **2.0x:** Only for very long waits (avoid if possible)

### Transitions
- Simple cuts between scenes (no fancy transitions)
- Brief fade to black between major sections (optional)
- Quick crossfade for montage sequences

### Caption Timing
- Each caption: 3-5 seconds on screen
- Transition captions while action continues
- One key point per caption (never two sentences)

### Music
- Start at 0:10-0:15 (after "problem" shots)
- Consistent volume throughout
- Fade out over final 5-8 seconds
- Suggested: Upbeat, inspiring, modern (from YouTube Audio Library)

## Thumbnail Suggestion

**Concept:** Before/After split

**Left side:**
- Messy spreadsheet (screenshot)
- Red X or "wrong" indicator
- Grayscale or desaturated

**Right side:**
- Beautiful proposal (screenshot)
- Green check or "right" indicator
- Full color, vibrant

**Text overlay:** "Stop Planning Like This" or "There's a Better Way"

**Create in:** Canva (free) - search "YouTube thumbnail", use split template

---

## Alternative: "Speedrun" Social Media Cut

30-60 second version for Twitter/LinkedIn:

1. Start with clean Claude Desktop (2 sec)
2. Type trip request (5 sec, sped up)
3. Flash of conversation (3 sec)
4. Type "publish this trip" (3 sec)
5. Published proposal loads (5 sec)
6. Quick scroll of highlights (10 sec)
7. "voygent.ai" end card (3 sec)

Caption: "From conversation to published trip proposal in under a minute. That's Voygent."

No music needed for social (often watched muted anyway).

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too much text on screen** - Keep captions to 5-8 words max
2. **Moving too fast** - Viewers need time to read and understand
3. **Showing errors** - If something fails, re-record that scene
4. **Cluttered screen** - Close everything except what you're demonstrating
5. **Tiny text** - If showing code or details, zoom in or use larger fonts
6. **Too long** - Cut ruthlessly; 3-4 minutes is better than 5-6
7. **Burying the magic** - Show the beautiful proposal early, then explain how

---

## Success Metrics

After publishing, track:
- View count and retention (where do people drop off?)
- Click-through to voygent.ai
- Sign-up conversions from video viewers

If retention drops at a specific point, that scene may need re-cutting.
