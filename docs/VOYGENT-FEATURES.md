---

## What is Voygent?

Voygent is a professional memory layer that connects to your AI assistant, giving it the ability to remember your clients, store trip details, and publish beautiful proposals—all without switching apps or learning new software.

You keep using the AI you already know. Voygent just makes it smarter about travel.

## How It Works

```
Your AI Account (Claude or ChatGPT)
         │
         │  One-time connection setup
         ▼
      Voygent
         │
         ├── Remembers your clients and trips
         ├── Validates dates, logistics, pricing
         ├── Publishes proposals your clients can view
         └── Tracks feedback and changes
```

**Setup takes 2 minutes.** Add your Voygent connection URL to Claude or ChatGPT settings, and you're ready to plan.

## Features

### 1. Persistent Memory Across Sessions

**The Problem:** AI assistants forget everything when you close the chat. Start a new conversation and you're explaining the same trip again.

**With Voygent:** Every trip, client preference, and booking detail is saved. Pick up exactly where you left off—tomorrow, next week, or from your phone.

> "Show me the Johnson family trip"
>
> *Voygent loads their 7-day Italy itinerary with all flights, hotels, and tours intact.*

### 2. Detailed Trip Building

Build complete trip packages with all the details your clients expect:

| Section | What's Captured |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Travelers** | Names, ages, special needs, preferences |
| **Flights** | Routes, times, confirmations, seat preferences |
| **Lodging** | Hotels, room types, rates, check-in/out dates |
| **Itinerary** | Day-by-day activities with times and locations |
| **Tours & Excursions** | Names, operators, pickup times, confirmations |
| **Dining** | Restaurant reservations, cuisine preferences |
| **Budget** | Estimated costs, payments received, balance due |

All structured data—not just notes. Your AI understands the difference between a flight segment and a hotel booking.

---

### 3. Smart Validation

Before you send a proposal, Voygent checks for problems:

**Logistics**
- Flight arrival times vs. hotel check-in
- Sufficient layover times
- Tour schedules that conflict with meals

**Completeness**
- Missing confirmation numbers
- Unspecified room types
- Activities without times

**Budget**
- Commission calculations
- Deposit tracking
- Balance due dates

> "Validate the Costa Rica trip"
>
> *⚠️ Warning: Tour scheduled for Day 3 conflicts with flight arrival time. Consider moving to Day 4.*

### 4. Beautiful Client Proposals

Publish professional proposals your clients can view on any device:

- **Responsive design** - Looks great on phones, tablets, and desktops
- **Interactive maps** - Embedded Google Maps for every location
- **Destination videos** - YouTube videos showcasing each stop
- **Tiered pricing** - Show value, premium, and luxury options side by side
- **QR codes** - Easy sharing at in-person meetings
- **Your branding** - Your agency name, logo, and contact info

Proposals are hosted on your own subdomain (e.g., `youragency.somotravel.us`) and update instantly when you make changes.

---

### 5. Client Feedback Loop

Clients can leave comments directly on proposals:

> *Client: "Can we do the wine tour on Tuesday instead? We have a wedding Saturday."*

Comments appear in your AI conversation the next time you open it:

> "You have 2 new comments on the Henderson trip"

Respond, make changes, and republish—all from the same chat interface.

---

### 6. Quote Import

Paste booking confirmations and let AI extract the details:

> "Import this quote: [paste email confirmation]"

Voygent parses:
- Supplier and booking reference
- Dates and times
- Pricing and payment terms
- Cancellation policies

No more manual data entry from confirmation emails.

---

### 7. Profitability Analysis

Understand your margins before you finalize:

> "Analyze profitability for this trip"

**Sample Output:**
| Component | Cost | Commission | Rate |
|-----------|------|------------|------|
| Cruise fare | $4,200 | $420 | 10% |
| Shore excursions | $680 | $136 | 20% |
| Travel insurance | $320 | $96 | 30% |
| **Total** | **$5,200** | **$652** | **12.5%** |

*Suggestion: Consider adding a private transfer ($180, 15% commission) to increase margin.*

---

### 8. Specialized Expertise On Demand

Load expert prompts for specific trip types:

| Command | Expertise |
|---------|-----------|
| "Load cruise instructions" | Cabin categories, deck plans, dining times, port logistics |
| "Load flight search guide" | Routing options, fare classes, layover optimization |
| "Load destination research" | Visa requirements, seasonal considerations, local customs |

Your AI becomes a specialist in seconds.
